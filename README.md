#### _Allows user to order a customized pizza, June 21, 2019_

#### By _**Erik Irgens**_

## Description

_This webpage is designed to allow users to enter their name, and their address, before continuing on to choose between a selection of options. For now, the only option is to create a customized pizza. The user may then create a pizza by selecting between various sizes, and topping options. Once the user has built the desired pizza, they may create the pizza, and - if ready to - may then place their order. Proof of concept. It won't take your credit card information._

## Known Bugs

_Unfortunately, on smaller displayes - such as phones and tablets - the creation page has issues displaying both the left and right panels correctly. This issue is due to the size of the buttons and cards over-writing the boundaries, and requires some work with media queries to work properly._
